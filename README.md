# Sign-language-detection
Developed an user-friendly platform that detects the hand gesture and translate it to English language
application.py uses webcam of the desktop and analyze the hand gesture with the canvas made in it
data collection.py is used for collecting hand gesture for data and training the model
in this I have used teachable to make model.
i have also attached the png for sample of the alphabets
